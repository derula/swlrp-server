    <h3>Description</h3>
    <article>
        <p>
            The SWLRP Roleplay Profile Add-On allows you to create and view rich, detailed character sheets for
            roleplaying within Secret World Legends. You can add a picture, in-character information and background, and
            out-of-character notes to express yourself and your character in as much detail as desired.
        </p>
        <p>
            The SWLRP Add-On is an open-source project made by the SWL RP community. You can find the source code -- as
            well as repots bugs and issues -- at
            <a href="https://github.com/derula/swlrp-server">https://github.com/derula/swlrp-server</a>.
            (Note: The 'source code' is NOT the same as 'downloading the add-on'. For that, see below.)

    <h3>How to Make/Edit a Profile</h3>
    <article>
        <p>
            After you download and install the add-on (see the 'Installing the Add-On' sections), log into the game. You
            should see a red 'RP' button at the top of your screen. If you click on the 'RP' button while you do
            <em>not</em> have someone else clicked (highlighted in green), it will open the screen to register a
            password or login.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you've never used the add-on before on this character, create a password. This is a safety feature to
            ensure that no one else can ever edit your personal RP character. The password is per-character, not
            per-account! But you can use the same password on multiple characters, if you want. If you have already
            created a password for your character, you will be prompted to enter it and log in.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Important!</strong> Write down your password or save it somewhere. If you forget it, it's <em>not
            easy</em> to get it back!
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you are logged in, you'll see the blank profile screen (see the 'Screenshots' section). Click the
            'Change Profile' button at the bottom to edit the various fields and add text, pictures, etc. You can change
            the profile picture by clicking on the placeholder image. Use the tabs across the top to fill in other
            sections. When you are done editing your profile, you can Preview it or Save it.
        </p>

    <h3>How to View Someone Else's Profile</h3>
    <article>
        <p>
            You can view someone else's profile in two different ways. Firstly, if you move your reticule over someone,
            you can hit 'F' to open the menu. There will be a new 'RP Profile' option at the bottom of the menu.
            Selecting this will show the person's profile (if they have one). You can also view someone's profile by
            clicking the 'RP' button at the top of your screen, if you have them selected as your target (highlighted in
            green).

    <h3>FAQ/Known Issues</h3>
    <article>
        <dl>
            <dt>
                Q: Is the SWLRP Roleplay Profile Add-On related to the TSWRP mod from 'The Secret World'?
            </dt>
            <dd>
                A: Not directly. It was inspired by the TSWRP mod, but Acenth (the creator of the TSWRP mod) has moved
                on from TSW and requested that a new mod be made to replace his. You can read about it
                <a href="http://www.tswrp.co/">on the TSWRP homepage</a>. So, with Acenth's knowledge and blessing, we
                started work on the SWLRP Add-On, which has a completely unique code base, backend, and appearance.
            </dd>
            <dt>
                Q: So who made the SWLRP Roleplay Profile Add-On?
            </dt>
            <dd>
                A: At SWLRP version 1.0, the main contributors are Samera (Flash coding), Tungsten (backend webserver),
                and Spellsmith (design/graphics/appearance). However, SWLRP is open-source so that anyone can improve
                and refine it. That way if any of us move on from the game, other people can hopefully pick up and
                maintain the add-on from there.

    <h3>Installing the Add-On - Steam</h3>
    <article>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <a href="SWLRP10.zip">Download the SWLRP Add-On</a>. This is a .zip file.
            </li>
            <li>
                Unzip the contents of the add-on to your SWL custom Flash directory. For a 'normal' Steam-based SWL
                installation, this is:
                <pre>C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Secret World Legends\Data\Gui\Custom\Flash</pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                Ensure you have unpacked it correctly. You should have a "FriendlyMenu.swf" inside your Flash directory,
                as well as a separate folder called 'SWLRP'.
            </li>
            <li>Restart Secret World Legends.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            If the add-on is installed correctly, you should see a red "RP" button on your top toolbar. You can move
            this button to your desired location by clicking the SWL 'lock' icon in the upper right corner, dragging the
            RP button to a new location, and then click the 'lock' icon again to save the location.
